# Cpp-insurance-groceries-project
In Excercise 1 of this porject I used objects in C++ to calculate the monthly cost of a clients 
insurance policy based off of their life style, such as if they were a smoker or not.

In Excercise 2 I used a boolean operator with objects as well to output the highets priced grocery item.
